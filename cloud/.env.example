# Database - Connection Pooling with PgBouncer
#
# APPLICATION CONNECTION (via PgBouncer - pooled)
# Use this for all runtime database access. The ?pgbouncer=true flag disables
# Prisma's prepared statements which don't work with transaction-mode pooling.
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://valuerank:valuerank@localhost:6432/valuerank?pgbouncer=true"

# DIRECT CONNECTION (bypasses PgBouncer)
# Used by Prisma Migrate for schema migrations. Migrations require a dedicated
# connection and don't work through connection poolers.
