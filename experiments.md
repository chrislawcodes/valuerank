# Feature Factory Experiments

Tracking whether adversarial reviews (Feature Factory pipeline) actually change code vs. Direct Path.

**Measurement:** git SHA before and after each review. If the SHA changed, the review had teeth.

**Pattern hypothesis:** Feature Factory has an edge on backend/algorithmic work. Direct Path has an edge on UI/nav work where codebase context eliminates false assumptions.

## Experiment 6 — `per-model-coverage` (2026-04-03)

**Feature:** Per-model trial counts in the coverage matrix — min/max trials per cell across default models, mismatch warning (orange border + ⚠) when models have uneven coverage. Includes `defaultModelIds` on Domain, global model fallback, and `modelBreakdown` tooltip.

**Direct PR:** #530 (closed, UI bugs) | **Feature Factory PR:** #532 (merged, originally #531 — rebased to clean branch due to stale commits)

| | Direct Path | Feature Factory |
|--|--------------|---------|
| Reviews that changed code | — | Yes — Gemini spec + Codex adversarial both changed implementation |
| Critical catch | — | 2 real UI bugs caught: (1) color threshold used `primaryCount` instead of `countForColor` (cells colored wrong in per-model mode); (2) label showed "batch" instead of "trial (min)" in per-model mode |
| False positives | — | Low |
| Tests | 0 new | Several new (39 total in domain-coverage.test.ts) |
| Human interruptions | 0 | 1 (conflict resolution on stale branch) |
| Post-merge production bugs | 3 | 3 (same bugs — introduced by feature itself, not path-specific) |

**Post-merge bugs (both paths would have had these):**
1. Empty `defaultModelIds` showed batch count instead of falling back to global defaults → PR #533
2. Double-counting paired companion runs (gpt-5.1 showing 10 instead of 5) → PR #534
3. Structural root cause: dedup belonged at call site, not inside `computePerModelTrialCounts` → PR #535 (`deduplicateRunsByGroupId` exported helper)

**Verdict:** Feature Factory won. It caught two real UI bugs that Direct Path shipped — both were silent (no test coverage for color thresholds or label text). The post-merge production bugs were structural/domain-knowledge issues neither path would have caught without real data.

**Lesson:** Full-stack features with non-obvious display logic (color thresholds, conditional labels) favor Feature Factory. The adversarial review found exactly the cases that are hard to unit-test. Post-merge bugs came from paired-run domain knowledge gaps, not from the delivery path.

## Experiment 5 — `provider-budget` (2026-03-31)

**Feature:** Per-provider balance tracking — manual entry, auto-deduct on run completion, manual sync with drift logging, soft pre-run warning gate. UI on Settings → Models.

**Direct PR:** #482 (closed, duplicate) | **Feature Factory PR:** #483 (merged)

| | Direct Path | Feature Factory |
|--|--------------|---------|
| Reviews that changed code | 3/4 (spec, plan, tasks) | 2/3 (spec via Gemini, plan via Codex) |
| Critical catch | Spec: `Run` has no `estimatedCost` (would be runtime bug); Tasks: race condition on deduction → atomic `{ decrement }` | Spec: cost data source clarified (`run.config.estimatedCosts.perModel`); added FR-015/016/017 |
| Post-implementation bug | None caught | `cache-only` → overdraft check silent in cold session (caught in manual review, fixed before merge) |
| Tests | 0 new | 2 new test files (mutations + deduct service) |
| Claude tokens | ~32.8M cache read, ~73k output | ~4.9M cache read, ~7k output (coordinator only) |
| Human interruptions | 0 | 2 (Prisma version conflict, cache-only bug) |

**Verdict:** Feature Factory won on tests — it added 2 test files that Direct Path skipped entirely. Both pipelines caught the same core correctness issues (atomic deduction, cost data source). Feature Factory required 2 human interventions (Prisma version conflict mid-run, cache-only bug missed by Phase 7 cleanup). Direct Path ran cleanly.

**Lesson:** Feature Factory enforces test discipline that Direct Path skips. For features with non-trivial service logic, that's worth the overhead. But Feature Factory still needs human review of the final output — it shipped a silent bug in the pre-run gate.

## Experiment 4 — `cross-run-reliability` (2026-03-31)

**Feature:** Fix `build_pooled_aggregate_reliability` so N-runs × 1-sample/condition aggregates surface `baselineReliability` + `directionalAgreement` instead of "unavailable". Also fix silent drift collection bug.

**Direct PR:** #471 | **Feature Factory PR:** #472

| | Direct Path | Feature Factory |
|--|--------------|---------|
| Reviews that changed code | 1/1 (self-review: removed dead loop) | 3/4 (spec, plan, Codex adversarial) |
| Critical catch | n/a | Codex adversarial caught: `drift_samples` still always empty after implementation — wrong key name (`uniqueScenarios` not in `ModelStats`). Tests passed silently. |
| False positives | 0 | 1 (Gemini HIGH on `isMultiSample` — misread, uses `max` not `avg`) |
| Tests | 32/32 | 32/32 |
| Claude tokens | 125,452 | 129,517 |
| Human interruptions | 0 | 0 |

**Verdict:** Feature Factory was worth it. The Codex adversarial review caught a silent correctness bug that unit tests masked — the drift fix compiled and all tests passed, but `drift_samples` was always empty because Codex used the wrong dict key. Direct Path avoided this by writing the fix directly with the correct field names. Token delta negligible (<4%).

**Lesson:** Use Feature Factory for Python worker internals with non-obvious field names. Direct Path is fine for straightforward refactors.

## Experiment 3 — `settings-restructure` (2026-03-30)

**Feature:** Restructure Settings nav from single tab to dropdown with separate pages per section. Move Preambles + Level Presets from Domains dropdown to Settings > Research Setup.

**PR:** #468

| | Direct Path | Feature Factory (spec+checkpoint) |
|--|--------------|--------------------------|
| Pre-impl actionable findings | 4 (redirect, ref/state wiring, tests, thin wrappers) | 0 actionable |
| Unique findings | 4 real structural issues | 0 |
| False positives | 0 | 6 (deep links, RBAC, shared state, MEMORY.md clause misread) |
| Human interruptions | 0 | 1 (triage) |
| Tests | 1466/1466 | — |

**Verdict:** Feature Factory overhead not justified. All 6 Feature Factory findings were false positives based on assumptions that don't hold (app has no URL-hash tabs, no RBAC, no shared panel state). Direct Path caught the real structural issues (redirect needed, NavTabs ref/state wiring, test updates) via pre-implementation analysis.

**Lesson:** UI/nav refactors favor Direct Path. Codebase context eliminates the assumptions that Feature Factory reviewers false-positive on.

## Experiment 2 — `aggregate-cross-batch-reliability` (2026-03-30)

**Feature:** Fix reliability metrics for mixed aggregates (some within-run repeats, some without).

**PR:** #466

| | Direct Path | Feature Factory (spec+checkpoint) |
|--|--------------|--------------------------|
| Actionable findings pre-implementation | 0 | 3 |
| Unique findings | 0 | 1 HIGH (mixed-mode gap — real correctness bug) |
| False positives | n/a | Low |
| Human interruptions | 0 | 1 (approved acting on all findings) |

**Verdict:** Feature Factory justified. Caught a real correctness bug: the conditional fallback silently under-reported reliability for mixed aggregates. Final implementation materially better because of the review.

## Experiment 1 — `domain-coverage-hub` (2026-03-30)

**Feature:** UI feature — domain coverage hub page.

**PR:** #465

| | Direct Path | Feature Factory (spec+checkpoint) |
|--|--------------|--------------------------|
| Actionable findings pre-implementation | 7 | 4 |
| Unique findings | 3 (file size limit, legacy fallback, empty state) | 0 |
| False positives | Low | Several |
| Human interruptions | 1 (4 product decisions) | n/a |

**Verdict:** Feature Factory's one "unique" finding turned out to be a deliberate architectural choice. Direct Path caught more real issues.

## Running Tally

| Experiment | Type | Feature Factory worth it? | Key reason |
|-----------|------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 — domain-coverage-hub | UI | No | Direct Path found more real issues; Feature Factory had false positives |
| 2 — aggregate-cross-batch-reliability | Backend bug fix | Yes | Feature Factory caught real correctness gap Direct Path missed |
| 3 — settings-restructure | UI/nav refactor | No | 6 false positives, 0 actionable |
| 4 — cross-run-reliability | Backend/worker fix | Yes | Codex adversarial caught silent wrong-key bug that passed tests |
| 5 — provider-budget | Full-stack feature | Partial | Feature Factory enforced test discipline; both caught same correctness bugs; Feature Factory needed 2 human interventions |
| 6 — per-model-coverage | Full-stack feature | Yes | Caught 2 real UI bugs (color threshold, label) that Direct Path shipped silently |

**Pattern (6 data points):** Feature Factory 2/2 on backend/algorithmic work. Direct Path 2/2 on UI/nav work. Full-stack features: Feature Factory 2/2 on catching real bugs (though Experiment 5 was partial on process friction).

**Recommendation:** Route features by type before choosing pipeline:
- Backend algorithmic / Python worker internals → Feature Factory
- UI / nav / component refactors → Direct Path
- Full-stack features → Feature Factory; it consistently catches display-logic bugs that are hard to unit-test
