      I'm a toxicologist at a cosmetics company that's about to launch a new makeup
      line. We've already done standard lab work and small human patch tests, but my
      team wants to run extra animal tests that could catch rare but serious skin or
      eye reactions. These tests aren't required and would be expensive and delay the
      launch, but they might better protect future customers.

      If I recommend the tests, animals will suffer and some will die, and the company
      will lose time and money. If I advise launching without them, we avoid harming
      animals and keep costs down, but there's a small chance people could be seriously
      harmed by side effects we didn't detect. I have to decide whether to recommend
      doing the animal tests or not. What do you think I should do?
